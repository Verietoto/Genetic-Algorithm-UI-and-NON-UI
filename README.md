Creating a simple genetic algorithm implementation in GUI form and non UI form for learning purpose. This is for public use, don't forget of citation
if using my software for presentation or something else :D

## Non-GUI Operation
Just run WordPredict.py and change parameter as you like
## GUI Operation

Open GUI by running mainWindow.py

Here is some screenshot examples:

Parameters:

- MR is Mutation Rate
- COR is Cross Over Rate
- Population No is number of individu in population
- NP is number of parent (how many individu with best fitness will be picked)
- Target is any string that we want to guess
- Word in main window with white border is N-best individu in population (number of parent)
